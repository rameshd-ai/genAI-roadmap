 Hello, all my name is Krishnayak and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys, yet another amazing video for Agente.ai. In this specific video, we will try to create a video summarization application, Agente.ai application. And here we are going to specifically use a new model that is called as Google Gemini. Right? And I hope everybody knows about Google Gemini model. So we will try to build it completely end to end. Step by step will be going ahead. As usual, I'll keep there's some targets for all this Agent K.I videos that are coming in this specific channel. At least minimum 1000 likes along with that, we will also target it for 200 comments. So please make sure that you leave your lovely comments and make sure that you like this particular video and definitely share with many of your friends. Now before I go ahead, I really want to go ahead and share my screen. We were discussing about Phi data. I will take up one more project and we'll start working on this and here we will be talking bottom video summarized. As I told, Phi data already provides you some amazing models. So one of the model that we are going to use is Gemini AI Studio. So we will be using this Google underscore API and a scope key. We will create it and then we will use it. Now before I go ahead, guys, quickly, I would like to make a quick announcement. We are coming up with this amazing life, building a genetic AI and genetic genetic way AI application with Cloud Platform Bootcamp. And if you have not seen it, please make sure that you go ahead in the description. You go ahead and check out the particular course. So here you'll be able to see the course info. I will be providing this link. The class is going to start from January 25th. The timing will be 3 pm to 6 pm IST Saturday and Sunday. And the price of the course is somewhere on 4500 rupees I N R and here we are going to cover both Gen. Agentika and Gen. VIA application with cloud boot camp, right? Like we'll cloud platform will be covering how to build Gen. application in AWS, GCP, how to perform fine tuning and many more things. The mentors of this particular course will be Paul, Mang, Krish and Sunny. Okay. So all these people will be there and will be there to help you out. Now let's quickly go ahead and start working on this particular application. As I said, the first thing that we are going to do is that first of all, we need to get the Google API key, right. Now in order to get the Google API key, you have to go to Google AI studio. And once you probably go over here, you can click on get API key. Okay, and you can create your own API key over here, right? You can just go ahead and click click on this and you can create it. I've already uploaded many, many projects related to Google Germany already in my YouTube channel. I have shown it, right? So I have taken already the API key. Now let's start coding on our like a use case that we really want to work on. So here I've created a folder which is called as video summarizing. Now let me quickly go ahead and create my file that is called as app.py. As I said, the application that we are going to specifically develop is something called as video summarizer. That basically means we will upload a video and with the help of that particular video, we'll just go ahead and analyze and ask any kind of questions that we want from that agent AI application. So quickly, let me first of all hide my face so that you focus on the coding. So over here, we are going to probably use streamlets. So for import streamlit as ST and I have already imported streamlit and this is my requirement.txt if you want to probably go ahead and see it. So this is my requirement or TXT. Here I'm going to use streamlit, Phi data, Google generative AI, opening AI and Doug Doug goes search. So here I have also removed open AI because since we are working with Google generative AI but if you just have this four libraries it will be more than sufficient. Okay. So let's go ahead and start coding. So here, first of all, we are going to import our streamlit. And along with streamlit, we are also going to use our phi.agent. So here you'll be getting a clear idea, right? How you can specifically work with the agents and all. And since we are working with the use case, that is related to video summarizer, right? So here I'm going to write from phi.agent, import, import agent itself. And this should be capital A. I don't know why it is basically coming as all the time and I go ahead and write it, it comes as capital A small A. Then from phi dot model, dot Google, I'm going to go ahead and import Gemini. So we will be using Gemini. So after importing Gemini, I'm also going to provide some features that are related to Doug Doug Go search. So quickly, I will go ahead and write from phi dot..go I will go ahead and import...go. So this is another library that we are going to specifically use. I'm just saying that here when I'm talking about agentic AI, I should probably integrate them with some kind of tools. So, Doug.go will be doing some kind of web search. So if I write any question related to a specific video to probably analyze and do also web search, it will be able to do it. Then I will go ahead and go ahead and import from Google.gen.bi. We are going to import two files. One is upload file and the reason we are going to upload this file and there is also something called as get file. I will talk about it as we go ahead. Then I'm going to go ahead and import time. Then from pathlib, from pathlib, I'm going to import path. So this is also done. The next thing what I'm actually going to do is that I'm also going to create a temporary file. So that once I upload a video, I should be able to load it over there. Along with this from dot ENV, I'm going to import load underscore dot ENV. I will go ahead and initialize load underscore dot ENV and I'll also go ahead and do this. The reason why I'm doing this is that I should be able to get my API keys, right? So, I will go ahead and first of all create my API key itself. So, quickly I will open my dot ENV file. Google API key. I think I've saved the API key in my notebook. Let me quickly go ahead and paste it over here. Okay. my API key at least. Any hope I usually delete all the API keys once I probably upload a video. Right. Then now what we are basically going to do is that I will have my API key. So let's get the API key. So API key is called to OS dot get Env. Okay. And here I'm going to go ahead and use my Google underscore API underscore key. Okay. So we are trying to get the API key from here by using this OS dot get ENB, right? Then if I get the API key, I'll put a condition saying that, hey, let's go ahead and set it to Genie I dot. Oh, I've not imported Genie I so I will just say import google dot generady vi as genie i. Okay, so I will just go ahead and configure this. Uh API key. So here I will go ahead and write API and this cookie is equal to API and it's okay. Right. So I'm just going to set up this particular API key. Now, uh, the remaining things that we are done doing is basically, We need to set up a streamlit app. So first of all, let's go ahead and set up some basic page configuration at all. So here I will just go ahead and write. And here I'm going to use a model which is called as Gemini 2.0 Flash. So I'm going to set up a page config where I'll say multi-model AI agent. I'll write, I'm your video summarizer. Okay. Page icon, this I've taken it from Google layout wide. ST dot die tell will be multi model video AI summarizer agent. So I'm just going to go ahead and write this powered by Gemini 2 point of flash experience. Right. Now it's time that we start go ahead and create our agent. Right. So I will go ahead and write ST dot catch and score resource. And here I will be going and creating a function, which will be nothing but I'll go ahead and write initialize underscore agent. Okay. This will be a function and here I'm going to just go ahead and initialize it. So I'm going to return agent which we have already imported. First of all, we'll go ahead and give the name. I will write video AI summarize some summarize okay and then I have my model so model will be nothing but I will go ahead and use Gemini Gemini here I'm going to use the ID is equal to Gemini 2.0 flash exp okay so this is one of the model that we have in Gemini and how do I get it? You can probably go ahead and explore it from here. So quickly, so here you'll be able to see like flash it be experimental all different different models are there whichever you want to use it you can specifically use it okay but for my instance I'm just going to go ahead and use this one which I have actually written okay then my initialization of the agent is is basically done. The markdown is equal to true. I have to probably also integrate some AI tool sorry some Doug Doug go search tool also right over here. So, quickly let me write comma and here I am going to specifically use tools and this will be a list of tools. Let us say my Doug Doug go tool which you are going to initialize it over here and then I'm going to go ahead and set markdown is equal to true. Perfect. Done. Now, let's go ahead and initialize the agent. I'll go ahead and create my multi-model agent. Or let me call my multi-model underscore agent is equal to. I will just call my function, which is called as initialize agent. So once I initialize this, my agent will be there. Now I'm just going to go ahead and make sure to create a file uploader. So quickly, let's go ahead and copy and paste it. So it'll be nothing but a video underscore file. File uploader, sht.file uploader, we can upload an mp4 file, mov.tv and help upload a video for AI analysis. Then I will also show you some code wherein I will be giving some user query. along with that we will also create an analyze button. So this will be really simple. I probably don't have to explain the markdown and all because it will be of no use. The main aim is basically to create the agent. So here if you see over here, multi model agent, I will copy and paste it. So I've copied and pasted some code over here, which you can probably see it. So what we are doing is that if there is a video file, If you are uploading a video file, we will go ahead and write that particular video file. Then this sht.video file will get displayed below. We have our user query. It's just like a prompt or something we need to probably display over there. Ask anything about the video, the AI, the agent will analyze and gather additional information. A month soon as I click on analyze video, it should be spinning, it should be processing. But here you'll be able to see, first of all, we'll get the file. is my prompt, analyze the uploaded video for content and context, respond to the following queries using video insights and supplementary web search. Okay, so this is just like a video summarizer along with video chat, right? So we here we are specifically chatting also with the video content, okay, if you want, okay. And then you'll be able to get it. So here I'm using this multimodal agent, dot run and we are creating this analysis prompt and along with that, whatever video we are specifically getting over here in the form of the process video. Okay. There is one disadvantage of writing the specific code, the maximum video size that you can upload is 200 MB. But if you have video more than 200 MB, then we have to use an external cloud. And that is what we are specifically teaching in the course, right? How to probably scale it in the cloud and all right? So just to see the code, how it looks with respect to the cloud. So here is the entire code you can see right. Gemini AI agent here we have written condition like if the file is greater than 200 MB then what we do is that we upload it in the s3 bucket then we probably take the video and all. But anyhow I will be giving you this specific code which you can actually explore further okay. So here is it now let's quickly go ahead and see whether our requirement or txt has all the libraries. So first of all I need to have stream late file data, Google Genitive and the go search. If you see over here, this agent, once we are getting this multimodal agent, we are running it over here. So multimodal agent.run with the prompt, analyze the uploaded video for context and then we are also giving the process videos. And here you can give any number of videos in the form of list. Okay. Quickly, let's go ahead and open by terminal. So first thing first, what you really need to do is that I will clear the screen. You just go ahead and install all the requirements because that is necessary. You have to have all the requirements over here. So once you have all the requirements done, then you can go CD. I will just go to my video summarizer. I will clear the screen and then I will go ahead and write stream, let run. You need to need be in your specific environment, right? Then I will go ahead and write ab.py. Now let's see whether this will run or not. So here everything is opening, right? Find data video, you guys summarize or there's this, this. I will just go ahead and select, see here, maximum video size that you can probably take is, you know, hardly 200 MB. If it is more than 200 MB, I have to take this particular, I have to stream this video to the cloud, okay? AWS cloud. So now let's ask summarize the video and list the key points and also search the web about the topic that is mentioned in the video. Now I will just go ahead and analyze it. Okay, so it will take some time again this is a 29 seconds video. I think it was 16.4 mb but anyhow it will be. I've also written the also search the word about a topic that is mentioned in the video so that would be amazing to see like what we are going to get over here okay. Let's wait for some time and then you have to you'll be able to see it. A couple of things over here that you have to check. So here you have this announcement video the first genitive AI bootcamp. Specific example from search results, Google offers a genie, I bootcamp, Pega, this, Amazon also. And summary, genitive AI bootcans are instant SIP program designed to equip this and this. So this just was an announcement video, the syllabus, everything. Now you can see that quickly we are able to see all this information. Isn't it amazing, right? So definitely go ahead and check out my genitive AI bootcamp Because if you want to probably develop this kind of application, I'll definitely help you out. And we are looking for more amazing projects that is going to come up in this. So we will also probably do all these things as we go ahead. So this looks good. Nice. So all the information is there. But only the disadvantage, you need to have only files that is less than 200 MB. If it is greater than 200 MB, I already showed you the code. That probably I will be covering in my course also, how to probably upload it in the Sri bucket and then stream it and do multiple things. Okay. So I hope you like this particular video and yeah, this was it from my side. I will see you all in the next video. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
